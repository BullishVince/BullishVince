I run the websites **[LearnJavaScripts.com](https://learnjavascripts.com)** and **[BullishLife.com](https://BullishLife.com)**.  
I use these websites for publishing things I know about software development. The content can be anything between backend development and infrastructure to UX-design, frontend stuff and blockchains, if I'm interested in it I'll probably publish content about it 😎
