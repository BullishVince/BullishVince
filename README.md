### Hi there 👋

Name's Vincent. 
I'm a developer in my 20's 😄.  
  
I run the websites [LearnJavaScripts.com](https://learnjavascripts.com) and [BullishLife.com](https://BullishLife.com). I use these websites for publishing things I know about software development. The content can be anything between web development and infrastructure to UX-design and blockchain, if I'm interested in it I'll probably publish content about it 😎
